    <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">1. Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Pick 4 Baseball (“the Game”, “we”, “us”) is a weekly, skill‑based baseball prediction contest.
        By creating an account, submitting picks, or paying an entry fee, you agree to these Terms of Service.
        If you do not agree, do not use the Game.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">2. Eligibility</h3>
    <p>
        To participate, you must be 18 years or older, a U.S. resident, and not reside in states that restrict
        paid fantasy contests (including but not limited to: Washington, Idaho, Nevada). Only one account per
        person is permitted. We may request proof of eligibility.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">3. Game of Skill</h3>
    <p>
        Pick 4 Baseball is a game of skill. Outcomes depend on player knowledge, statistical understanding,
        and strategy in selecting weekly picks.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">4. Entry Fees & Prize Pools</h3>
    <p>
        Players pay either $5 or $10 per week to participate. Entry fees are allocated as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>80%</strong> → Weekly Prize Pool</li>
        <li><strong>10%</strong> → End‑of‑Year Prize Pool</li>
        <li><strong>10%</strong> → Game maintenance, hosting, development, and administrative costs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We do not participate in the prize pool. All allocations are transparent and fixed.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">5. Payouts & Rollover Rules</h3>
    <p>
        If there is at least one weekly winner, the Weekly Prize Pool is paid out according to the published rules.
        If there is no weekly winner:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>75%</strong> of that week’s prize pool rolls over to the next week</li>
        <li><strong>25%</strong> is added to the End‑of‑Year Prize Pool</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This rollover continues until a weekly winner is determined. We may correct scoring errors or adjust results
        if MLB statistics are updated or corrected.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">6. Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Entry fees are non‑refundable except in limited circumstances. Refunds will only be issued when:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A charge is shown to be a duplicate</li>
        <li>A technical or system error caused an incorrect charge</li>
        <li>An issue is investigated and proven to require a refund</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Refunds are not provided for user mistakes, missed pick submissions, poor performance, disagreements with scoring,
        or MLB schedule changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the <strong>Pick4Baseball game itself</strong> (not MLB games) is suspended, paused, or permanently discontinued,
        refunds may be issued at our discretion for unplayed weeks.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">7. User Conduct</h3>
    <p>
        You agree not to create multiple accounts, collude with other players, exploit bugs, harass users, manipulate scoring,
        or engage in chargeback fraud. We may suspend or terminate accounts at our discretion.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">8. Game Changes</h3>
    <p>
        We may modify, pause, or discontinue the Pick4Baseball game at any time, including rule adjustments, scoring changes,
        maintenance, season resets, or cancellation of the Game. These changes do not refer to MLB games or MLB scheduling.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>
        We are not liable for outages, delays, scoring errors, data loss, or third‑party failures. Your use of the Game is at
        your own risk. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid in entry fees in the last 30 days.
    </p>

        and payouts are final.
    </p>
