            <p class="lead">
                PICK 4 Baseball began the same way a lot of great ideas do — with friends,
                spreadsheets, and a whole lot of chaos. What started as a weekly MLB prediction
                game tracked manually in Excel and settled through Venmo quickly grew into
                something bigger.
            </p>

            <p>
                We built PICK 4 to take that same friendly competition and give it structure:
                automated scoring, clean leaderboards, secure payments, and a polished experience
                that keeps the fun while removing the hassle.
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s still the same game at heart — pick your players, compete with friends,
                and try to win their money — but now it’s fast, fair, and built for the entire season.
